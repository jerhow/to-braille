  <p>Hello there!</p>
  <p>
    This is a pet project, an English to Braille translator.
    <br />
    The curious are welcome to try it <a href="translate">by clicking here</a>.

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Backstory, for those interested in programming:</span> 
    <br />
    I recently became interested in Braille. Also of late, I've been looking for 
    an idea which I could implement with Action Cable, the WebSocket library
    that ships with Rails 5 and later. A real-time translator seemed like fun, hence this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this proof-of-concept, the browser sends the individual characters, as they are typed, to the server for translation.
    This communication runs over a persistent WebSocket connection to a Rails backend running Action Cable. 
    The translated braille is sent back to the client over the same WebSocket, and rendered as unicode html entities 
    in a separate DOM element.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simple yet very cool, especially when you're used to stateless, half-duplex HTTP programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right now the app does Grade 1 (uncontracted) Braille translations. As I spend additional 
        time building out the app, Grade 2 contractions should become possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Proper support for capitalization
      </li>
      <li>
        Minor bug fixes and enhancements
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
