# ToBraille

A small side project which implements a real-time English to Braille translator with [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and Action Cable

### Rationale
I recently became interested in Braille. Also of late, I've been looking for an idea which I could implement with [Action Cable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html), the WebSocket library that ships with Rails. A real-time translator seemed like a fun way to continue exploring Braille, hence this project.

### Notes
Built with Ruby 2.6 + Rails 5.2 + WebSockets

### More to come
- Currently the app does [Grade 1](https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/what-is-braille/#Grade1Braille) (uncontracted) Braille translations. As I spend more time with it, [Grade 2](https://brailleworks.com/braille-resources/what-is-braille/#Grade2Braille) contractions should become possible.
- Proper support for capitalization
- Minor bug fixes and enhancements
