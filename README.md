# ToBraille

A small side project which implements a real-time English to Braille translator with Rails and Action Cable

It's a work in progress, but you can check it out here: [tobraille.com](https://tobraille.com)


### Rationale
I recently became interested in Braille. Also of late, I've been looking for an idea which I could implement with Action Cable, the WebSocket library that ships with Rails. A real-time translator seemed like a fun way to continue exploring Braille, hence this project.

### Notes
Built with Ruby 2.6 + Rails 5.2 + WebSockets

More to come:<br/>
- Right now the app does Grade 1 (uncontracted) Braille translations. As I spend more time with it, Grade 2 contractions should become possible.
- Proper support for capitalization
- Minor bug fixes and enhancements
